# Data Structures & Algorithms: A Multi-Language Implementation Library

This repository serves as a curated, multi-language library of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a clean, tested, and well-documented reference for these core computer science concepts, suitable for accelerating development, creating training materials, or as a technical reference.

## Guiding Principles

Each implementation in this collection adheres to the following principles:

* **Tested & Validated:** Each module is accompanied by a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure correctness, reliability, and edge-case handling.
* **Clean & Idiomatic Code:** The focus is on writing clear, maintainable, and idiomatic code that follows the best practices of each respective language.
* **Well-Documented:** Every concept includes its own `README` explaining its principles, common use cases, and a performance analysis (Big O notation for time and space complexity).
* **Multi-Language Perspective:** Where applicable, concepts are implemented in multiple languages (e.g., Python, C++) to compare and contrast different programming paradigms and standard library features.

## Navigation

The repository is organized by concept, with language-specific implementations nested within.

-   **/Data_Structures:** Contains foundational data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.
-   **/Algorithms:** Contains fundamental algorithms for Sorting, Searching, Graph Traversal, and more.

Feel free to use the code within as a building block for projects or as a reference for technical implementation.
